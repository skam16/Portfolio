    <h2>Computer Science Tutor: Oct 2023 - Present</h2>
    <p>I currently work Part-time at Metro State University as a Peer Computer Scence Tutor. This position requires
        me to help students from diverse backgrounds, try and understand what way the concepts can be conveyed to a student as I see
        students who may want a different approach. It also teaches me to have patience and try to understand why a student may be having difficulties with a certain
        concept, for example "Is there a concept from an earlier class which might not be making sense hence the problem with the different concept?"
    </p>
    <p>Job Responsibilities include assisting students and helping them understand:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C Programming</li>
    <li>CSS and HTML</li>
    <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
