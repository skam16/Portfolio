        <h2>Computer Science Tutor: Oct 2023 - Aug 2025</h2>
        <p>I used to work Part-time at Metro State University as a Peer Computer Scence Tutor. This position required
            me to help students from diverse backgrounds, try and understand what way the concepts can be conveyed to a student as I see
            students who may want a different approach. It also teaches me to have patience and try to understand why a student may be having difficulties with a certain
            concept, for example "Is there a concept from an earlier class which might not be making sense hence the problem with the different concept?"
        </p>

        <p>Job Responsibilities include assisting students and helping them understand:
            <ul class="main-section-list">
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C Programming</li>
            <li>CSS and HTML</li>
            <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
