<h2>A Summary of Me:</h2>
<p>
   Hi, my Name is Kamran (american-version: Cameron), I am currently a student at Metro State University 
   pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. I like understanding concepts rather than cramming them as I am
   not that good at memorizing things but have realized that I remember things when I understand them. I am 
   a quick learner, provide me with the right resources and I can connect the dots and understand it.
   I like challenges, if someone says I can't then I feel I definetley have to prove them wrong.
